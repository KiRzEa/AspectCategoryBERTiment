# AspectCategoryBERTiment

## Overview

**AspectCategoryBERTiment** is a repository dedicated to performing fine-grained aspect category sentiment analysis using BERT. The goal is to identify the sentiment of a specific category within a given review. This approach leverages the power of BERT to provide accurate and nuanced sentiment analysis at the aspect category level.

## Introduction

Aspect category sentiment analysis is a fine-grained task in sentiment analysis where the sentiment of a specific aspect or category within a review is identified. This repository focuses on using BERT to achieve this task, combining the robustness of transformer-based models with the specificity required for aspect-level analysis.

## Installation

To get started with AspectCategoryBERTiment, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AspectCategoryBERTiment.git
cd AspectCategoryBERTiment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset in the following format:
- Each entry should contain a review, the aspect category, and the corresponding sentiment.

### Training the Model

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path path/to/your/data.csv --model_path path/to/save/model
```

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/saved/model --data_path path/to/evaluation/data.csv
```

## Data

The dataset should be structured with the following columns:
- `review`: The text of the review.
- `category`: The aspect category to be analyzed.
- `sentiment`: The sentiment label (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

Example:

| review                              | category | sentiment |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| The battery life is great.          | battery  | positive  |
| The screen resolution is poor.      | screen   | negative  |
| The camera quality is acceptable.   | camera   | neutral   |

## Model

AspectCategoryBERTiment uses BERT as the backbone model for sentiment analysis. The model is fine-tuned on the aspect category sentiment analysis task.

## Training

Training involves fine-tuning BERT on your dataset. The training script allows customization of various hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

## Evaluation

The evaluation script computes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the model on the test dataset.

## Results

After training and evaluation, the results will be saved in the `results/` directory. Detailed performance metrics and model checkpoints will be available for review.
